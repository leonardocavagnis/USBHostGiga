# ðŸ”Œ [ALPHA] USBHost library for Arduino STM32H7 boards

The Arduino USBHost_H7 library provides a convenient way to manage USB peripherals on Arduino boards based on the STM32H7 microcontroller. Currently, the library is compatible only with Arduino Giga R1 boards.

This library has been created to overcome the limitations of the [Arduino_USBHostMbed5](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_USBHostMbed5) library.

The APIs are very minimal and subject to change; please just use for evaluation purposes.

ðŸ“– For more information about this library please read the documentation [here](./docs/).
